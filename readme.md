About the Project:

I created a interactive website using HTML, JavaScript and CSS to display Hannah Butler's handbags. 

The website will be designed to enquire about bags that the user likes. They will not have the ability to purchase them straight off the site.
This feature will be added later on when the bags are stocked. 
As no bags have been fully completed yet, I will be using bags from mattandnat.com with thier descriptions and images.
Their will therefore only be 3 bags on the site with 3 different colour schemes,
these will each have thier own web page which can be accessed page with the similar bag they are interested in. 

I began by meeting with Hannah to discuss what she wanted displayed and the colour scheme/feel of the website.
She explained that she wanted a upmarket feel with the website being just off-black and white with the bags the only colours.
Hannah liked the idea of having a large slideshow which uses javascript to enable the user to flick through the slides.

I then designed the prototype screens for mobile and web view by sketching them with the features I felt would suit each page.
You can find these sketches in the documentation folder. 

I then completed the website with full functionality.

You can find my accessability map as the Hutler Site Diagram which shows how the pages link together.

I selected a font which matched the logo for the brand.

Javascript is used in the slideshow on the index page and on the contactus page form.

I have used the google maps api for the contact us page.

After completing the website, I created a questionnaire to give Hannah to see how she found the website's accessability and design.

I hope you enjoy using the website.
