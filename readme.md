About the Project:

I created a interactive website using HTML, JavaScript and CSS to display Hannah Butler's handbags. 
I began by meeting with Hannah to discuss what she wanted displayed and the colour scheme/feel of the website.
She explained that she wanted a classy feel with the website being just off-black and white with the bags the only colours.
Hannah liked the idea of having a large slideshow which uses javascript to enable the user to flick through the slides.
